# # C++ laboratories

Lab exercises from my 4th semester on AGH University of Science and Technology.
- at the beginning of each lab we got one ready-made file that we could not edit,
- each task had to be solved in 90 minutes, including logging in, reading the task and sending solution,
- doucumentation was written in polish as required,
- the program had to compile, otherwise there were no points. Moreover output had to be identical to that provided in description.
